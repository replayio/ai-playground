# Proposed RAG Implementation Plan

## Overview
The proposed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation will utilize a powerful cloud-based model for generation, specifically GPT-3, and augment it with locally stored embeddings. This hybrid approach aims to combine the generative capabilities of GPT-3 with domain-specific knowledge contained within the local embeddings.

## Components
- **Cloud-based Model**: GPT-3 will be used for generating responses based on the input prompt and the context provided by the local embeddings.
- **Local Embeddings**: A database or index of embeddings that represent domain-specific knowledge. These embeddings will be retrieved based on their relevance to the input prompt.
- **Retrieval System**: An efficient search algorithm, such as BM25 or a neural retrieval model, will be employed to find the most relevant local embeddings for a given prompt.

## Data Flow
1. The input prompt is received by the `run_prompt` function.
2. The retrieval system queries the local embeddings database/index to find the most relevant embeddings.
3. The top embeddings are selected and combined with the input prompt.
4. The combined input is fed into GPT-3, which generates a response.
5. The generated response is returned by the `run_prompt` function.

## Interaction Between Components
The local embeddings serve as an additional context for the cloud-based model, allowing it to generate responses that are informed by domain-specific knowledge. The retrieval system plays a critical role in ensuring that the most relevant embeddings are selected to augment the generative process.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the selection of the retrieval algorithm.
- Determine the structure and format of the local embeddings database/index.
- Establish the method for combining the retrieved embeddings with the input prompt.
- Integrate the cloud-based model (GPT-3) with the local retrieval system.
- Test the end-to-end functionality of the RAG implementation.
