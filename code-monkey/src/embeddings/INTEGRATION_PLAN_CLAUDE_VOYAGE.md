# Integration Plan for Claude 3.5 and voyage-code-2

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to integrate Claude 3.5, a cloud-based language model, with voyage-code-2 embeddings to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality. The goal is to enrich Claude 3.5's generative capabilities with the contextual knowledge of local codebase embeddings.

## Components
- **Claude 3.5**: A cloud-based language model for generating responses.
- **voyage-code-2**: Provides embeddings for local files containing code.

## Process Flow
1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Utilize `voyageai.Client().embed()` to generate embeddings for all local files containing code.
   - Store these embeddings in a structured database or index for efficient retrieval.

2. **Prompt Processing**:
   - Generate an embedding for the input prompt using `voyageai.Client().embed()`.

3. **Embedding Retrieval**:
   - Implement a retrieval system to compare the prompt embedding with stored file embeddings to identify the most relevant ones.
   - Employ cosine similarity or an advanced retrieval algorithm for accurate matching.

4. **Integration with Claude 3.5**:
   - Combine the prompt with the retrieved embeddings to provide a rich context to Claude 3.5.
   - Claude 3.5 generates a response that reflects the combined input.

5. **Response Generation**:
   - The response from Claude 3.5, now informed by the local codebase context, is returned to the user.

6. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of the end-to-end process with a variety of prompts.
   - Refine the retrieval system and integration method based on test outcomes and user feedback.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the database or index structure for storing embeddings.
- Develop the retrieval system for embedding comparison.
- Establish the method for combining embeddings with prompts for Claude 3.5.
- Integrate the system and perform end-to-end testing.
- Iterate based on testing feedback to optimize the RAG functionality.
