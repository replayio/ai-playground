# TODO

* Try some local/offline models:
  * e.g. `ollama`
  * e.g. `fabric --listmodels`
* NOTE: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or any proper local/offline models will need a GPU and/or a powerful setup. We'll have to investigate that.


# Start coding for the day

* Just make sure `rye` is activated and sync'ed!


# Setup

* Just install [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/basics/) and put it in your startup script.
